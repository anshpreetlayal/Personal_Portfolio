                  <td>Positivity</td>
                  <td>when things tend to go wrong, I have a cheerful outlook. I think it's crucial to be positive in everyday life.
                    Having a positive outlook enables you to take charge of your own life and how you perceive it. Additionally, 
                    it supports my creativity and productivity. Being around people with great attitudes and enthusiasm will cause them 
                    to rub off on you since positive attitudes are contagious. Even when they're not feeling so great themselves,
                     I can always brighten someone else's day by being optimistic! Being amiable, thoughtful, 
                     and kind is key since these traits benefit everyone.</td>

                    It's not only about who you work with; it's also about the method you employ to get there. I am capable of communicating my
                     opinions and worries about topics while still respecting those of others.</td>

                    <td>Being adaptive is crucial for success in today's digital world. People and businesses must be ready to adapt their tactics as
                        needed in order to stay competitive in an environment of constant change. This necessitates not just a solid technical basis but
                         also a persistent desire to learn and develop. I can outgrow conditions and keep up with everyone by being flexible.</td>
