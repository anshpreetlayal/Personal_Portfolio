        <h1>Watching...</h1>
        <p>
            Whenever I have some free time or after finishing my work, I indulge in watching anime, K-dramas, and movies. Anime, with its diverse art styles, compelling storylines, and emotional depth, has garnered a large and devoted following.
            Genres like action, comedy, romance, horror, and science fiction are some of the many styles it encompasses. Some of my favorites include Jujutsu Kaisen, Hunter x Hunter, Attack on Titan, Cowboy Bebop, Fruits Basket, Violet Evergarden, Demon Slayer, among others.
            I watch for entertainment, unique personalities, and engaging narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
            K-dramas captivate me with their captivating stories, characters, and music. Their unpredictability, twists, and multifaceted characters set them apart. The music adds depth to each character's journey. Favorites like Vincenzo, Reply 1988, Hospital Playlist resonate deeply.
        </p>

            Additionally, I have a profound love for movies, particularly those by Studio Ghibli. Films like Ponyo, Kiki's Delivery Service, The Wind Rises, Howl's Moving Castle hold a special place in my heart. They evoke emotions and leave a lasting impact. I also enjoy Hollywood and foreign films including The Grand Budapest Hotel, Parasite, The 400 Blows, Ocean's 11 and 13, Seven, 3 Idiots, among others.

        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>
            Reading is a cherished hobby of mine. I delve into various genres including manga, romance novels, and other literary works. Books offer a unique insight into the thoughts and minds of authors and readers alike. Romantic fiction allows me to explore perceptions of love and passion, providing a glimpse into future aspirations.

            Manga, with its distinct visual storytelling, provides a different reading experience. It's an art form that goes beyond narrative, allowing artistic expression alongside storytelling.

        <h3>Learning Languages</h3>
        <p>
            Apart from these hobbies, I also have a keen interest in learning languages. Exploring new languages opens doors to understanding different cultures and broadens perspectives.
