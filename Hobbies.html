               <h1>Watching Anime/Kdramas/movies</h1>
                <p>Whenever I am free or finish my work, I tend to watch anime,Kdramas or movies
                    What is anime? Anime is a subculture that is loved by many. Its art style, constant story lines, and emotional dialogue have a huge following.
                   It consists of many different styles and genres including action, comedy, romance, horror, science fiction and more.
                   Jujutsu Kaisen, Hunter x Hunter, Attack on Titan, Cowboy Bebop, Fruits Basket, Voilet Evergarden, Demon Slayer, and more shows are some of my favourites.
                   I do so for a variety of reasons. For amusement just occasionally, other times for personalities or stories.Â 
                  Why I watch it and a description of anime and som example too.
                  I watch kdramas because of the wonderful stories, characters, and music. Kdramas are my favorite things to watch because they are so different from other types of movies.
                   The plots are unpredictable and often have many twists that keep you guessing what will happen next. The characters are lovable but complex at the same time because they 
                  all have their own flaws and problems. The music in most kdramas is also one of the best parts about them. It helps set the mood for each scene and adds an extra dimension to each character's story.
                  Some of my most favourite ones are Vincenzo, Reply 1988, Hospital Playlist.
                  In addition to them, I enjoy watching movies. Some of them are films by Studio Ghibli, which I adore deeply. Ponyo, Kiki's delivery service, The Wind Rises, Howl's Moving Castle,
                   and other Ghibli films and characters have always captivated me. Every time I watch them, I enjoy the way they make me feel. I occasionally watch other Hollywood and foreign movies.
                    The Grand Budapest Hotel, Parasite, The 400 Blows, Ocean's 11 and 13, Seven, 3 Idiots, and many other films that are still on my list are some of my absolute favourites.</p>
                <h2>Reading</h2>
                  <p>One of my numerous interests is reading, and I frequently read manga, romance novels, and other types of publications.
                    I can enter into the souls and thoughts of others through books. Any book worth reading is a window into the thoughts of the author's readers. You get better at reading as you read more.
                  I enjoy romantic fiction because it gives me a glimpse into how we perceive love and passion in our daily lives and how we could hope for it in the future.  
                  Reading manga is a beautiful experience because it's totally different from reading books and novels. Manga is the Japanese equivalent of comic books,
                  but unlike American comic books, manga serves as more than just a vehicle for narrative. It is distinctive among all other types of art since it can also
                  be used as a canvas for drawing and painting.</p>
