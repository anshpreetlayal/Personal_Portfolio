          <div class="centered">I have studied in India till 9th grade at Swami Sant Dass Public School, first semester. After that, I immigrated in Canada in 2019, I started my high school in second semester of 9th grade
                    at Lincoln Alexander High School. Later I finished my schooling at another High School. Currently I am studying at Humber College.
                    I have taken up the Computer Programming course and will finish it in  2024. I chose to study computer programming.
                    Right now, while studying at Humber college, I want to achieve my goals to learn computer programming 
                    and hope to continue my study once I know in which field I specifically want to into.
                    As of now, I am interested in Web designing.</div>
